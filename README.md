  Fun program to show Monte Hall problem
  Author: Douglas Rosenberg
  This progrm is to help people understand the Monte Hall problem
  I did not see any explainations where the entire probablity space is presented as tuples
  Assigns a winning leaf as 1/9
  Assigns a non-winning leaf as 1/18
  This program models Losing doors when you swtich as a non-equal Probitlity Space where Monte will reveal each Losing door
  an equal number of times on the 3rd stap.
  This make each losing choice as 1/18.
  Most explainations skip this part and just assign a losing choice as 1/9
